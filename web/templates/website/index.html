                <h1>Welcome to Empire</h1>
                
                <p>The Empire of Adana has existed for six hundred years. The imperial house exerts only loose control over its major vassals and
                    the empire much resembles a broad confederation or alliance. Nonetheless, for most, that has meant six centuries of relative
                    peace after the cataclysmic Third Greytide. The empire's neighbours have rarely been able to challenge it openly. Some worry
                    that times are changing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city of Sanctuary is the capital of the empire and home to the imperial court, a term encapsulating any noble who happens
                    to be in the city, and any commoner able to move in noble circles. Sanctuary is the social heart of the empire, the place where
                    alliances are formed and plans made, where even the most restless of adventurers go to find companions and to plan their next steps.

                    Empire is a multiplayer text-based roleplaying game. In it, you portray a character from the empire. The day-to-day of the game
                    is focused on the city of Sanctuary, but you can take actions and participate in events which reach far beyond it.
                </p>

                <p class="text-muted small">Posted: September 2025</p>
                <p>It is spring of 632 AF, six centuries since the Empire of Adana was founded. The Empire has enjoyed a long period of relative stability, but events in recent years threaten to undo all that.
                    The formal coronation of Koline Otrese, although empress since 631, is due. It is a formality, but one which gathers many people, and leads to a great deal of bustle in the capital.
